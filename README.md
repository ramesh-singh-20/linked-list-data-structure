# linked-list-data-structure

**Defining ADT (Abstract Data Type)**

Create a list data structure with following functions:

Retrieve an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
Insert an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
Update an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
Delete an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
size of the list: Time complexity should be O(1).
check to see if list is empty: Time complexity should be O(1).

Make sure all index operations throws IndexOutOfBoundsException for invalid index.

**Assumption**:

LinkedList is of integer type.

**Testing**

Spock framework with Groovy is used for unit testing.
